These constraints may include a semantic classification of the sought after answer and may even suggest using different strategies when looking for and verifying a candidate {answer.This} paper presents a machine learning approach to question classification. We learn a hierarchical classifier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answer types, and eventually classifies questions into fine-grained classes. We show accurate results on a large collection of free-form questions used in {TREC} 10.},

In contrast to Li and Roth (2002)'s approach which makes use of very rich feature space, we propose a compact yet effective feature set. In particular, we propose head word feature and present two approaches to augment semantic features of such head words using {WordNet.} In addition, Lesk's word sense disambiguation ({WSD)} algorithm is adapted and the depth of hypernym feature is optimized. With further augment of other standard features such as unigrams, our linear {SVM} and Maximum Entropy ({ME)} models reach the accuracy of 89.2\% and 89.0\% respectively over a standard benchmark dataset, which outperform the best previously reported accuracy of 86.2\%.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different learning methods on a prototypical natural language disambiguation task, confusion set disambiguation, when trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data than has previously been used. We are fortunate that for this particular application, correctly labeled training data is free. Since this will often not be the case, we examine methods for effectively exploiting very large corpora when labeled data comes at a cost.},

This paper presents a Spanish Question Classifier based on machine learning, automatic online translators and different language features. Our system works with English collections and bilingual questions ({English/Spanish).} We have tested two Spanish-English online translators to identify the lost of precision. We have made experiments using lexical, syntactic and semantic features to test which ones made a better performance. The obtained results show that our system makes good classifications, over a 80\% in terms of accuracy using the original English questions and over a 65\% using Spanish questions and machine translation systems. Our conclusion about the features is that a lexical, syntactic and semantic features combination obtains the best result.},

	abstract = {Question classification is very important for question answering. This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches. We have experimented with five machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors ({NN)}, Naive Bayes ({NB)}, Decision Tree ({DT)}, Sparse Network of Winnows ({SNoW)}, and Support Vector Machines ({SVM)} using two kinds of features: bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams. The experiment results show that with only surface text features the {SVM} outperforms the other four methods for this task. Further, we propose to use a special kernel function called the tree kernel to enable the {SVM} to take advantage of the syntactic structures of questions. We describe how the tree kernel can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming. The performance of our approach is promising, when tested on the questions from the {TREC} {QA} track.},
